# 1. Business Problem

### Description

**Airbnb** is an American company which operates an online marketplace focused on short-term homestays and experiences. Its business model allows anyone to offer or book accommodation around the world.

**Purpose:** to predict which country a new user's first booking destination will be. This is a classification problem. 

**Strategy:** we used the CRISP-DS (Cross-Industry Process - Data Science) as the main project management methodology.

# 2. Business Assumptions (Formulated Hypotheses)

The following hypotheses were formulated in order to be tested:

**H01.** To every destiny, users take 15 days, on median, to do the first booking, since their first activity.

**H02.** To every destiny, users take 3 days, on median, from first activity until create an account.

**H03.** The number of bookings to US increase 20% yearly during the summer.

**H04.** Female users booking are 10% higher to out of US than inside.

**H05.** Google Marketing channel represents 40% of the bookings to out of US.

**H06.** Country destination US represent more than 20% on every channel.
